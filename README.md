An autonomous local execution framework designed to interpret broken, unstructured human commands and map them directly into safe system automations. Powered by a multi-tenant asynchronous socket broker, a dynamic discovery catalog, and an adversarial self-healing staging engine.

## ⚡ Core Architecture Powers
* **Intent Standardization Layer**: Resolves unstructured or broken English commands into discrete, programmatic automation capabilities.
* **Google ARD Specification Manifest**: Uses dynamic JSON schemas (`ai-catalog.json`) to register and discover system components on the fly.
* **Arbor-Style Sandbox Staging**: Isolates unverified, AI-generated Python scripts inside a safe scratchpad directory (`C:\gm.ai\scratchpad`) to protect the host machine.
* **Cloudflare-Style Adversarial Harness**: Evaluates command structures using an independent firewall validation loop before execution.
* **Self-Healing Diagnostics**: Intercepts code syntax exceptions, formats the error traceback context, and coordinates automated correction cycles.
